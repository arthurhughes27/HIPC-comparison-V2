# R script to engineer preprocessed expression data into gene-set level fold-change features.
# We adopt a "cumulative information" approach 
# That is, we aim to see how accumulating information from multiple timepoints changes predictive quality
# Here, we start with a baseline set of predictors, then add on predictors derived at each one of some selected timepoints
